          <p>
            Hi. Our names are Sarah and Adi. We're two NNHS Alumn from the class of 2019, and we're here to share a little story with you.  
          </p>
          <p> 
            Last summer, we ran a pilot college essay summer camp in Adi's living room. During the last week of May, we began preparing the camp, 
            building curriculum, and sending out emails frantically, to see how many people we could get on board. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the incredible time crunch, things went surprisingly well. Our students loved the camp. Students from our 2019 Cohort will be attending schools like the 
            University of Michigan, University of Illinois for CS, and Vanderbilt.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Through sixteen hours of instruction over the course of a month last summer, we were able 
            to teach our students how to approach various types of college 
            essays (e.g. the Common App essay, ‚Äúwhy major‚Äù essays, ‚Äúwhy 
            school‚Äù essays, and ‚Äúcreative‚Äù essays) and how to create a 
            schedule / roadmap to chart out the college application process. 
            We also used the workshop as a forum to answer any and all 
            questions regarding the application process, such as the 
            differences between ED, EA, REA, and regular deadlines; the differences between liberal arts schools and traditional universities; what constitutes target, reach, and safety schools; when to ask for teacher recommendation letters; when to take and submit test scores; and much more!
          </p>
          <p><b>
              This summer, we're going to be expanding the size, revamping the curriculum, taking more feedback, and pushing ourselves to grow the program extensively.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p> 
            We plan on scaling our curriculum and prepping our teaching team to cover a wider range of college essay prompts, and dive deeper into mastering the Common Application itself. 
            We'll be investing more time into student's personal growth and working closely with them to build their personal roadmaps for professional and academic development.
